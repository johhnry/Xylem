## Installation
Use `git clone https://github.com/johhnry/Xylem` to clone the repo.

## Usage
The game is still in development so you can directly run the project with Godot by typing : 

```
cd Xylem/godot && godot
```

For now, you control the character by moving the mouse away from the center of the window. 
You can throw seeds by clicking with left mouse button.
